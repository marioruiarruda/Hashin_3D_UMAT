1) The UMAT has been updated since the initial publication, and since it is academic code it may not be
optimize, and some bugs may accour.

2) The UMAT was initialty formulated only for 3D, but extended to 2D. 
But the 2D analysis is not at the moment tested or validated, caution in the final results is advise.

3) By default the code is generated using Implicit Analysis, with the Stabilization Algorithm. 
For Geometrical Non-Linear Analysis, when using this code, the viscosity parameter should be below 1E-7.

4) Future versions of this UMAT will be posted without warning.

5) The matrix damage evolution has been updated into a new function, 
not present in the original manuscript to better simulate the 3D behaviour.
