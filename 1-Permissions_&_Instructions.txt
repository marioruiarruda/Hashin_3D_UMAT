----####--------R&D FORTRAN CODE--------####---
----####--------------------------------####---

1) The UMAT has been updated since the initial publication, and since it is academic code it may not be
optimize, and some bugs may accour.

2) The UMAT was initialty formulated only for 3D, but extended to 2D. 
The 2D analysis is not at the moment tested or validated, caution in the final results is advise.

3) By default the code is generated using Implicit Analysis, with the Stabilization Algorithm. 
For Geometrical Non-Linear Analysis, when using this code, the viscosity parameter should be below 1E-7.

4) Future versions of this UMAT will be posted without warning.

5) The Jacobian is written in terms of secant matrix (not tangent matrix),
therefore it is not expected an quadratic convergence when using ABAQUS standard,
and it is recomended to reduce some iterative criteria (in the step module) to allow convergence.

6) The matrix damage evolution has been updated into a new function, 
not present in the original manuscript to better simulate the 3D behaviour. 
This is in RED color in the Pre-Print_UMAT_Hashin_3D.pdf

----####------RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS------####---
----####--------------------------------####---

1) This is an UMAT made for ABAQUS 2022, using Intel Fortran Compiler 2016 for Windows 10.

2) The original code is in Fortran 90, and is not ready to run in classical ABAQUS linked with FORTRAN 77 flags, 
these need to be modified depending on the chosen compiler.
For this reason, the UMAT is already compiled into an .OBJ file for windows use and .O for linux use.
For ABAQUS above version 2020 this is no longer a problem and it can run directly files with extension f.90.

3) This can be used directly in the “command line or power shell” in windows user=umat.obj or in linux user=umat.o

4) For linux the .O object files was compiled using gfortran (from GNU project), 
it may not work with Linux Intel Compiler during the final LINKING.

5) Example on how to run a job with object files in ABAQUS
-Example in CMD “command line” for windows 10:
abaqus job=example cpus=2 user=umat.obj

-Example in terminal for linux:
abaqus job=example cpus=2 user=umat.o

Alternatively, with Intel Compilers, FORTRAN 77 standards can still be used,
if the directive !DIR$ FREEFORM is placed in the 1s line before the start of the UMAT,
and the extension is changed from .F90 to .FOR.
