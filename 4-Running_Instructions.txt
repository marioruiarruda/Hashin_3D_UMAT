1) This is an UMAT made for ABAQUS 2022, using Intel Fortran Compiler 2016 for Windows 10.
2) The original code is in Fortran 90, and is not ready to run in classical ABAQUS linked with FORTRAN 77 flags, 
these need to be modified depending on the chosen compiler.
For this reason, the UMAT is already compiled into an .OBJ file for windows use and .O for linux use.
3) This can be used directly in the “command line or power shell” in windows user=umat.obj or in linux user=umat.o
4) For linux the .O object files was compiled using gfortran (from GNU project), 
it may not work with Linux Intel Compiler during the final LINKING.

Example in CMD “command line” for windows 10:
abaqus job=example cpus=2 user=umat.obj

Example in terminal for linux:
abaqus job=example cpus=2 user=umat.o
